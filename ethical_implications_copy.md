When developing a Recipe Maker Food Application, there are ethical and professional responsibilities that developers need to handle with care. Arguably the most important responsibility is user security. Since the recipe app requires users to have authorized access, it is vital to implement data encryption and secure authentication. As developers, we should ensure that user info is stored safely to prevent unauthorized access and never shared without explicit consent.

Transparency is also another responsibility we have as developers. Being honest to users is a requirement as users place a lot of trust in us when downloading and using our recipe application. That is why our app is open source and readily available on GitHub. We are also very clear on what this app is for, and we have chosen not to add any overly ambitious or unnecessary features to our app.

As professionals, we also uphold our responsibility for code organization and documentation. By maintaining a helpful README.md file and a well-organized codebase with helpful documentation, fellow developers can understand how the recipe app works and why certain decisions were made. Alongside that, our folder structure and meaningful file and folder naming conventions also contribute to better app maintainability.
